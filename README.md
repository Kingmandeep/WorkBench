# WorkBench
To start using WorkBench, clone the repository and use 'mvn install' to compile the pom.xml builder file.

Then from the \target\ folder use 'java -jar BrainGridWorkbench-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' to run the application.

While Workbench works on any OS platform supporting Java 8, the associated BrainGrid requires a Linux based system to compile and run correctly.
Hence, one can run BrainGrid simulations via WorkBench locally on their machine if their machine is Linux based, or use 
the remote execution feature provided by Workbench.
